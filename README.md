## 💡 Tips to Maximize Acceptance

Based on community data and successful applications:

### ✅ What Works

1. **Apply in First 48 Hours**
   - Day 1-2 applicants: ~15% acceptance
   - Week 2+ applicants: ~4% acceptance

2. **Complete Optional Survey Fields**
   - Full survey: 4x higher acceptance vs bare minimum
   - Companies use this data for demographic targeting

3. **Build Platform History**
   - Xbox: Join Insider 3+ months before AAA betas
   - PlayStation: 6+ month PSN subscription
   - Steam: 50+ games library shows commitment

4. **Enable ALL Communication Settings**
   - Marketing emails are often selection criteria
   - Companies verify you'll receive their communications

### ❌ What Hurts Your Chances

- Multiple accounts (auto-blacklist if caught)
- VPN during signup (triggers fraud detection)
- Fake information (more companies verify than you think)
- Not participating after selection (future blacklist)
